# permissions
This bash script iterates through each item in the  /etc directory, checks if it's a file or directory, and prints its permissions using `ls  -ld`.

## Usage 
1. Clone or download the script file `peretc.sh`.
2. Make the script executable by running : ```bash
   
   chmod +x peretc.sh

   # Run the script
   ./peretc.sh
